### BaranClinic Platform: Developer Roadmap & Execution Plan
**Role: Developer/Owner** | **Platform Vision:** Enterprise-grade Veterinary SaaS

---

### PHASE 1: CORE DOMAIN DEVELOPMENT (Backend & Logic)
*Your Goal: Build the functional foundation of the microservices.*

#### 1.1: CRM & Patient Management (`crm-service`)
- [ ] **Data Modeling:** Implement `Owner` and `Pet` entities using JPA/PostgreSQL.
- [ ] **DDD Patterns:** Use Value Objects for `Address` and `Breed`. Define clear Aggregate boundaries.
- [ ] **Audit Trail:** Implement a basic event log or integrate **Axon Framework** for full event sourcing of medical history.
- [ ] **API Design:** Create REST endpoints for patient registration and owner profiles.

#### 1.2: Appointment & Scheduling Engine (`booking-service`)
- [ ] **Concurrency:** Implement distributed locking with **Redis/Redisson** to prevent double-booking slots.
- [ ] **Saga Pattern:** Implement an orchestration Saga (using **Spring Statemachine**) to coordinate booking, payment, and confirmation.
- [ ] **Notification Trigger:** Publish `AppointmentConfirmedEvent` to Kafka for downstream services.

#### 1.3: Clinical Notes & AI Integration (`clinical-service`)
- [ ] **Schema-less Storage:** Use **MongoDB** for flexible SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes.
- [ ] **AI Bridge:** Integrate **AWS Transcribe Medical** or a custom NLP service to process voice-to-text notes.
- [ ] **Search:** Sync clinical records to **Elasticsearch** for high-performance medical terminology search.

#### 1.4: Billing & Inventory (`billing-service` & `inventory-service`)
- [ ] **Transactional Outbox:** Ensure inventory is decremented only after a successful billing transaction.
- [ ] **Payment Integration:** Connect with **Stripe API** for handling clinic payments.
- [ ] **Stock Alerts:** Create a scheduled job to notify when medicine/supplies fall below threshold.

### PHASE 2: CI/CD PIPELINE (Automation & Quality)
*Your Goal: Automate testing and deployment for rapid delivery.*

#### 2.1: Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Unit/Integration:** Write tests using **JUnit 5** and **Testcontainers**. Aim for 80%+ coverage.
- [ ] **Contract Testing:** Implement **Spring Cloud Contract** to prevent breaking changes between microservices.
- [ ] **E2E:** Set up **Playwright** for critical path testing (e.g., "Owner books appointment").

#### 2.2: Infrastructure as Code & Pipeline
- [ ] **Containerization:** Write multi-stage `Dockerfiles` for each service.
- [ ] **CI Workflow:** Configure **GitHub Actions** to build, test, and scan images with **Trivy**.
- [ ] **GitOps:** Set up **ArgoCD** to sync your Kubernetes manifests with the cluster state.

### PHASE 3: DEVOPS & RELIABILITY (Infrastructure & Security)
*Your Goal: Ensure the platform is secure, observable, and scalable.*

#### 3.1: Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/K8s)
- [ ] **Terraform:** Define VPC, EKS, RDS, and Redis modules.
- [ ] **Service Mesh:** Deploy **Istio** for mTLS and traffic management.
- [ ] **Scaling:** Configure **Karpenter** for efficient node auto-scaling.

#### 3.2: Security & Identity
- [ ] **OIDC:** Set up **Keycloak** or **Auth0** for centralized authentication.
- [ ] **Secret Management:** Use **HashiCorp Vault** to store database credentials and API keys.
- [ ] **RBAC:** Implement role-based access for Vets, Admins, and Receptionists.

#### 3.3: Observability
- [ ] **Metrics/Logs:** Deploy **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Loki**.
- [ ] **Tracing:** Integrate **Micrometer Tracing** (Zipkin/Tempo) to debug cross-service requests.
- [ ] **Alerting:** Set up Slack/PagerDuty alerts for high error rates or latency.
