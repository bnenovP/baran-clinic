### BaranClinic Platform: Business-Driven Roadmap (Dog Edition)
**Role: System Architect / Product Owner** | **Developer: User**

---

### 🏛️ ARCHITECTURAL STRATEGY: "Monolith First"
We build a **Modular Monolith** using **DDD**.
**Phase 1 Goal:** Deliver a specialized Dog MVP.

---

### 📋 ACTIVE ASSIGNMENT: CRM PERSISTENCE
#### Business Case: "Canine Identity & Persistent Enrollment"
*Goal: Ensure dogs and owners are securely stored with unique identification.*

- [ ] **JPA Persistence Mapping:**
    - Map `Owner` and `Dog` entities to PostgreSQL.
    - Isolate CRM tables (e.g., prefix with `crm_`).
- [ ] **Unique Canine Identity:**
    - Enforce database-level uniqueness for `MicrochipID`.
    - Correctly store `DogWeight` (value + unit).
- [ ] **Schema Evolution:**
    - Implement Flyway migration (`V1__init_crm_schema.sql`).
- [ ] **Repository Implementation:**
    - Implement `OwnerRepository` and `DogRepository` using Spring Data JPA.

### 🛠️ ARCHITECT'S GUIDELINES
1. **Business Case First:** I provide the use case; you implement the logic.
2. **Dog Specialization:** Focus exclusively on canine requirements for the MVP.
3. **Context Isolation:** One context must not query another's database tables.

*Status: Awaiting Developer implementation of CRM Persistence.*
